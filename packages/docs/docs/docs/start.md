Welcome to the ZeppelinOS Documentation Site!

ZeppelinOS is a platform to develop, manage and operate smart contract
applications in Ethereum.

## Features

* Upgrades: fix and improve your contracts over time.
* Standard libraries: link your contracts to standard libraries already deployed on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

Install ZeppelinOS and setup your project as described in the [Setup guide](setup.md).

In order to use ZeppelinOS to build an upgradeable application, follow our
[Building upgradeable applications](building-upgradeable.md) guide.

If you would like to use the ZeppelinOS on-chain standard libraries in your app,
 follow our [Using the stdlib in your app](building-stdlib.md) guide. 

Finally, if you are interested in deploying your own standard libraries for ZeppelinOS,
see our [Developing a new standard library](developing.md) guide. 

Two demo apps based on ZeppelinOS are described in [Basil](basil.md) and [Crafty](crafty.md).


## Team

ZeppelinOS is developed by the [Zeppelin team](https://zeppelin.solutions/),
with contributions from the community.
