Welcome to the ZeppelinOS Documentation Site!

ZeppelinOS is a platform to develop, manage and operate smart contract
applications in Ethereum.

## Features

* Upgrades: fix and improve your contracts over time.
* Standard libraries: link your contracts to standard libraries already deployed on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

For a quick tour of the features and commands of
ZeppelinOS, go to the [Quickstart guide](quickstart.md).

For a more comprehensive look at how to build an upgradeable application using
ZeppelinOS, follow our
[Building upgradeable applications](building-upgradeable.md) Guide.

If you would like to use the ZeppelinOS on-chain standard libraries in your app,
 follow our [Using the stdlib in your app](building-stdlib.md) Guide. 

Finally, if you are interested in deploying your own standard libraries for ZeppelinOS,
see our [Developing a new standard library](developing.md) Guide. 

## Team

ZeppelinOS is developed by the [Zeppelin team](https://zeppelin.solutions/),
with contributions from the community.
