ZeppelinOS has an on-chain standard library with some of the most widely used contracts. These 
contracts come from [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity), an extremely well-tested Ethereum framework, with only slight modifications 
needed to adapt them to ZeppelinOS.  

The contracts presently included in the ZeppelinOS stdlib are:

- `DetailedMintableToken`
- `DetailedPremintedToken`
- `MintableERC721Token`
- `TokenTimelock`
- `TokenVesting`

The source code for these contracts can be found in the [`zos-release`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/zos-release/contracts) branch of the `OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity` repository.
