After installing ZeppelinOS and setting up a `zos` project as described in the [Setup](setup.md) guide, you are ready to create an upgradeable application.

You can start by writing the contracts as you would normally do, but replacing constructors with
`initialize` functions using the modifier from `zos-lib`. To install the lib:

```
npm install zos-lib
```

A simple contract would look like this:

```
import "zos-lib/contracts/migrations/Migratable.sol";

contract MyContract is Migratable {
  uint256 public x;

  function initialize(uint256 _x) isInitializer("MyContract", "0") public {
    x = _x;
  }
}
```

You might have noted that our sample contract has an `initialize` function instead of the standard contstructor. This is a requirement of ZeppelinOS's upgradeabiltiy system, you can learn more about this in our [Advanced topics](advanced.md) section. 

You can now compile the contract with:

```
npx truffle compile
```

## Initial Deployment

Register all the contract implementations of the first version of your
project running:

```
zos add <contract_name_1>
zos add <contract_name_2>
...
zos add <contract_name_n>
```

In our example, run:

    zos add MyContract

If you are working in a local development network like [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/), you will need to [configure](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/project#alternative-migrating-with-ganache) your `truffle.js` file before running the `push` command.

You can now push your application to the desired network by running:

```
zos push --network <network>
```

which will create a `zos.<network>.json` file with all the information specific to the chosen network. The format of this file is discussed in the [Advanced topics](advanced.md) section.

To create an upgradeable version of each of your contracts, run:

```
zos create <contract_name_1> --network <network>
zos create <contract_name_2> --network <network>
...
zos create <contract_name_n> --network <network>
```

This command takes an optional `--init` flag to call an initialization/migration
function after you create the contract. In our simple example we want to pass a value (_e.g._: 42) to the initialize function:

```
zos create MyContract --init initialize --args 42 --network development
```

After these simple steps, your upgradeable application is now on-chain!

## Upgrading your contracts

If, at a later stage, you want to upgrade your smart contracts' code in order to fix a bug or add a new feature, you can do it seamlessly using ZeppelinOS. 

Note that while ZeppelinOS supports arbitrary changes in functionality, you will need to preserve all variables that appear in prior versions of your contracts, declaring any new variables below the already existing ones. You can find details on this in the [Advanced topics](advanced.md) page. 

Once you've made the desired changes to your contracts, recompile them and push them to the network:

```
npx truffle compile
zos push --network <network>
```

Then, upgrade the already deployed contracts:

```
zos upgrade <contract_name_1> --network <network>
zos upgrade <contract_name_2> --network <network>
...
zos upgrade <contract_name_n> --network <network>
```

In our simple example:

```
zos upgrade MyContract --network development
```

The address of the upgraded contracts is the same as before, but the code has been changed to the new
version.

_Voil√†!_ You have deployed and upgraded an application using ZeppelinOS. 

If you want to use the ZeppelinOS standard libraries, please follow our [Using the stdlib in your app](using.md) guide. You can also check the API reference with [all the available commands of zos](climain.md).
